# DIY-Functions
DIY Functions Up until this point, whenever we have wanted to gather information about specific collections in our programs, we have relied on Kotlin standard library functions to give us the answers.  For example, we’ve used the sum() function to tell us the sum of the values in a list and the average() function to return the mean. We never had to fully understand how the program calculates this information; all we had to do was call a function on a collection and use whatever value the function returned.  In this project, we’re going to dive in and create five user-defined functions to collect and gather information about a list of numbers.  As you go through the project, check off the boxes next to each instruction as you complete them.  Note: We’ll be using the bash terminal to collect user input. For instructions on running the program in the bash terminal, see this exercise or the hint in instruction 17.
